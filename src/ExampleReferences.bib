	abstract = "{The Stream Control Transmission Protocol~(SCTP) as defined in RFC~4960 is an advanced Transport Layer protocol that provides support for multi-homing. That is, SCTP endpoints may simultaneously use multiple Network Layer addresses, which allows to connect the endpoints to multiple networks for redundancy purposes. However, for the transfer of user data, only one of the possible paths is currently used at a time. All other paths remain as backup and are only used for retransmissions.
Clearly, the existence of multiple paths has led to the idea of applying load sharing among the paths. An extension to SCTP -- denoted as Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT) -- realises this load sharing functionality. While this approach works well for similar paths, i.e.\ paths having similar characteristics regarding bandwidths, bit error rates and delays, the use of dissimilar paths does not work that neatly.
In this thesis, the issues of dissimilar paths for CMT-based load sharing will be demonstrated first. The reasons for these issues will be identified and solutions proposed. These solutions will be evaluated in simulations, as well as partially also in a real-world Internet testbed setup, in order to show their effectiveness. In particular, it will be shown that a combination of multiple mechanisms is necessary to make CMT work as expected under a wide range of network and system parameters.
Furthermore, the fairness of CMT-based transport -- in concurrency to classic non-CMT flows -- will be analysed. The usage of plain CMT leads to an overly aggressive bandwidth occupation on so-called shared bottlenecks. As a countermeasure, the idea of Resource Pooling will be utilised. For this purpose, two new and one adapted congestion control approach -- all based on the Resource Pooling principle -- will be introduced and examined in similar as well as dissimilar path setups, in order to show how to fairly deploy CMT transport in the Internet.
The results of this work have also been contributed to the ongoing IETF~standardisation process of SCTP and its extensions.}",

Dienste werden mittels eines geschichteten, hierarchischen Protokollstacks realisiert, bei welchem eine Interaktion nicht-benachbarter Schichten nicht vorgesehen ist. Dieser starre Aufbau macht bereits das Anpassen der Internet-Architektur an die Anforderungen der heutigen Anwendungen – wie etwa File Sharing, Videotelefonie und mobile Endgeräte – kompliziert. Die großen Herausforderungen des zukünftigen Internets – welches als das Future Internet bezeichnet wird – mit Anwendungsszenarien wie Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Sensornetzwerken und vielen weiteren – erfordern jedoch noch weitaus umfangreichere Anpassungen. Zudem ist eine große Flexibilität erforderlich, um auch weiteren – heute noch nicht absehbaren – Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.
Im Rahmen dieses Habilitationsvortrages wird zunächst kurz auf die Probleme des aktuellen Internets eingegangen sowie die Herausforderungen des Future Internets vorgestellt. Im Anschluss daran wird eine Auswahl der für den Übergang zum Future Internet möglichen evolutionären sowie revolutionären Ansätze vorgestellt. Der Schwerpunkt liegt hierbei auf den noch relativ neuen – und in der Forschung momentan sehr aktiv diskutierten – revolutionären Ansätzen, welche mit der Idee des sogenannten Clean Slate einen vollständigen Neuansatz anstreben. Hierbei werden die Ansätze der Funktionalen Komposition, des Content-Centric Networking sowie der Virtualisierung von Netzwerken vorgestellt. Zum Schluss wird dann auf die Frage eingegangen, wie eine Nutzung der vorgestellten Ansätze in der Praxis möglich ist und welche der aktuell in Diskussion befindlichen Ansätze sich in Zukunft voraussichtlich durchsetzen werden.}",

These functionalities as such are not new, but their combination into one generic, application-independent framework is.
Initial goal of this thesis is to gain insight into the complex RSerPool mechanisms by performing experimental and simulative proof-of-concept tests. The further goals are to systematically validate the RSerPool architecture and its protocols, provide improvements and optimizations where necessary and propose extensions if useful. Based on these evaluations, recommendations to implementers and users of RSerPool should be provided, giving guidelines for the tuning of system parameters and the appropriate configuration of application scenarios. In particular, it is also a goal to transfer insights, optimizations and extensions of the RSerPool protocols from simulation to reality and also to bring the achievements from research into application by supporting and contributing relevant results to the IETF's ongoing RSerPool standardization process.
To achieve the described goals, a prototype implementation as well as a simulation model are designed and realized at first. Using a generic application model and appropriate performance metrics, the performance of RSerPool systems in failure-free and server failure scenarios is systematically evaluated in order to identify critical parameter ranges and problematic protocol behaviour. Improvements developed as result of these performance analyses are evaluated and finally contributed into the standardization process of RSerPool.}",

	abstract = "{The Internet is developing with a very high speed. Just a few years ago, its main applications were file transfer and e-mail access, all based on the best effort TCP/IP service over quite slow links. With the quickly growing deployment of high-speed Internet accesses, there is a growing demand for also using the Internet in application scenarios like real-time multimedia streaming, particularly for audio and video on demand services. However, such multimedia applications do not only require sufficient bandwidth. They have stricter quality of service demands, like e.g.\ an upper bound on the transfer delay to ensure interactivity for their users.
In the context of this thesis, a system for the cost-efficient transfer of variable bitrate multimedia streams over Differentiated Services~(DiffServ) is presented and evaluated. This system supports layered transmission, i.e.\ streams may be partitioned into sub-streams denoted as layers (e.g.\ a video layer and an audio layer). Distinct layers may have different priorities as well as quality of service requirements and may therefore use different DiffServ classes for data transmission. Also, the streams may be scalable, i.e.\ the quality of the transferred media may be decreased in order to reduce the bandwidth requirements when bandwidth becomes scarce. Particularly, the system makes use of the fact that media files in e.g.\ a video on demand library can be analyzed a priorily. The information that is computed during the offline analysis is used to realize a dynamic and cost-efficient transport of layer data over different DiffServ classes. Furthermore, the system applies an adaptive buffering to smooth the flows -- in order to save bandwidth -- while also taking care of the delay constraints.}",

Currently, the IETF RSerPool working group is standardizing a protocol suite for Reliable Server Pooling, which copes with the challenge of providing high availability by using redundant servers. Servers for the same service are grouped into a server pool. A server in a pool is called pool element (PE), a user of a pool is called pool user (PU). When a PE fails, its PUs simply select another one from the pool and initiates an application-specific failover procedure. This fail-over is supported by the RSerPool protocol suite. Each PE registers at a name server and is then continously supervised by that specific name server. All name servers of an operational scope provide a redundant system for name resolution from pool handles to transport addresses of pool elements to pool users. RSerPool uses SCTP to provide network fault tolerance and address scoping functionality.
The RSPLIB is a prototype implementation of the RSerPool protocol suite, developed under the GNU Public License in cooperation between Siemens and the Computer Networking Technology Group of the University of Essen. It currently runs under Linux, FreeBSD and Darwin.
Our paper covers aspects of designing and implementing highly available applications using RSerPool with our RSPLIB implementation. First, we will give an introduction to the RSerPool protocol suite and an overview of the RSPLIB components. Then, we describe the RSPLIB API, especially focussing on the implementation of pool element and pool user programs to provide high reliability. Furthermore, we show our current implementation status and future plans. This will be followed by a short look on the problems that can arise when the RSerPool architecture is used. Finally, we give an example how RSerPool can be used to realize highly available services. And last but not least, we show how distributed computing architectures can make use of the RSerPool architecture.}",

While availability is one main aspect of RSerPool, load distribution is another. Since most of the time a server pool system runs without component failures, optimal performance is an extremely important issue for the productivity and cost-efficiency of the system. In this paper, we therefore focus especially on the load distribution performance of RSerPool in scenarios without failures, presenting a quantitative performance comparison of the different load distribution strategies (called pool policies) defined in the RSerPool specifications. Based on the results, we propose some new pool policies providing significant performance enhancements compared to those currently defined in the standards documents.}",

Furthermore, we will show performance issues raised by the management of large servers pools, as it is necessary for load balancing or distributed computing scenarios.

Dabei wollen wir insbesondere auch die Merkmale verdeutlichen, die RSerPool von existierenden Lösungen -- wie Linux Virtual Server (LVS) oder dem kommerziellen Cisco Distributed Director -- unterscheiden. Außerdem wollen wir vorstellen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel der Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrages werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementation rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementation vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen und Hardware lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran wenden wir uns kurz dem API der rsplib zu und zeigen, wie eigene Programme mit dessen Hilfe hochverfügbar gemacht werden können. Neben neuer, direkt auf RSerPool basierender Software, berücksichtigen wir dabei insbesondere auch die Anpassung bestehender Applikationen und stellen Möglichkeiten zur Migration vor. Zum besseren Verständnis werden sämtliche Beschreibungen von Code-Beispielen begleitet.
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken. Mit diesem System lassen sich die grundlegenden Eigenschaften von RSerPool – welche im ersten Teil des Vortrages vorgestellt wurden -- sehr anschaulich demonstrieren: die Verwaltung dynamischer Pools, Lastverteilung und Failover bei PE-Ausfall.

Server redundancy directly leads to the issues of load distribution and load balancing. Both are important and have to be considered for the performance of RSerPool systems. While there has already been some research on the server selection policies of RSerPool, an interesting question is still open: Is it possible to further improve the load balancing performance of the standard policies without modifying the policies -- which are well-known and widely supported -- themselves? Our approach places its focus on the session layer rather than the policies and simply lets servers reject inappropriately scheduled requests. But is this approach useful -- in particular if the server capacities increase in terms of a heterogeneous capacity distribution? Applying failover handling mechanisms of RSerPool, in this case, could choose a more appropriate server instead.
In this paper, we first present a short outline of the RSerPool framework. Afterwards, we analyse and evaluate the performance of our new approach for different server capacity distributions.

While there has already been some research on the server selection policies of RSerPool, an interesting question is still open: Is it possible to further improve the load balancing performance of the standard policies without modifying the policies -- which are well-known and widely supported -- themselves? Our approach places its focus on the session layer rather than the policies and simply lets servers reject inappropriately scheduled requests. Applying failover handling mechanisms of RSerPool, in this case, could choose a more appropriate server instead. In~[26], we have already shown that our approach is useful for homogeneous server pools. But is it also useful for heterogeneous pools?
In this paper, we first present a short outline of the RSerPool framework. Afterwards, we analyse and evaluate the performance of our new approach for different server capacity distributions. Especially, we are also going to analyse the impact of RSerPool protocol and system parameters on the performance of the server selection functionalities as well as on the overhead.}",

VoIP-Vermittlungsanlagen zur Weiterleitung von Notrufen oder e-Commerce-Anwendungen sind nicht akzeptabel. Zur Sicherstellung der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten bei Geräte- und Netzwerkausfällen müssen diese Komponenten redundant ausgelegt sein. Spezialisierte Redundanzlösungen – insbesondere z.B. für Web-Server – gibt es zwar viele, eine einheitliche, für viele Dienste nutzbare Lösung fehlte jedoch noch. Reliable Server Pooling, abgekürzt RSerPool, ist ein Rahmenwerk zur Bereitstellung hochverfügbarer Anwendungen durch redundante Server, es befindet sich zur Zeit in der Standardisierung durch die IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe. Im RSerPool-Konzept werden Server, welche den gleichen Dienst anbieten, zu einem Pool zusammengefaßt. Neben der Hauptaufgabe – der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten – ist insbesondere auch die Lastverteilung ein wichtiges Anwendungsgebiet von RSerPool.
Im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojektes haben wir -- die Arbeitsgruppe Technik der Rechnernetze am Institut für Experimentelle Mathematik der Universität Duisburg-Essen -- im Jahre 2002 damit begonnen, einen plattformunabhängigen RSerPool-Prototypen als Open Source unter GPL-Lizenz zu entwickeln. Mittlerweile wird unser Projekt durch die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) gefördert. Unser System läuft zur Zeit unter Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin (MacOS X) und Solaris, wobei die Unterstützung für weitere Plattformen – insbesondere auch für Embedded-Systeme – geplant ist. Als einzige vollständige Implementierung des zukünftigen RSerPool-Standards sind wir Referenzimplementierung der IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe und wirken mit Tests und Forschungsarbeiten aktiv in der Standardisierung mit.
In unserem Vortrag geben wir zunächst eine kurze Einführung zu RSerPool. Dabei wollen wir insbesondere auch die Merkmale verdeutlichen, die RSerPool von existierenden Lösungen – wie Linux Virtual Server (LVS) oder dem kommerziellen Cisco Distributed Director – unterscheiden. Außerdem wollen wir zeigen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel einer Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrags werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementierung rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementierung vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Solaris) und Hardware (x86, x64, PPC) lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran zeigen wir, wie das RSerPool-API dazu genutzt werden kann, eigene Anwendungen hochverfügbar zu machen und die Möglichkeiten zur Lastverteilung im Pool verwendet werden können. Ein Schwerpunkt dieser Einführung wird dabei insbesondere die einfache und effiziente Realisierung des Failover-Mechanisms sein, d.h. des Verfahrens zur Wiederherstellung eines Sitzungszustandes auf einem neuen Server nach Ausfall des alten. Im Besonderen werden wir dabei zeigen, welche Fähigkeiten RSerPool und sein API mitbringen um dieses – teilweise recht komplexe Thema – in vielen Fällen übersichtlich und mit wenigen Zeilen Programmcode zu lösen: Hochverfügbarkeit für eigene Anwendungen muß nicht kompliziert sein!
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken. Mit diesem System lassen sich die grundlegenden Eigenschaften von RSerPool – welche im Vortrag vorgestellt wurden – sehr anschaulich demonstrieren: die Verwaltung dynamischer Pools, Lastverteilung und Failover bei Serverausfall. Selbstverständlich werden wir unser Beispielsystem beim Vortrag auch in der Praxis demonstrieren, bei Vorhandensein eines Internetzugangs sogar mit einem Szenario aus weltweit verteilten Ressourcen.}",

There has already been some research on the server selection strategies of RSerPool for different application scenarios. In particular, it has been shown that the adaptive Least Used selection usually provides the best performance. This strategy requires up-to-date load information of the services, which has to be propagated among distributed pool management components. But network delay (which is realistic for systems being widely distributed to achieve availability in case of regional servers failures) as well as caching of information may both lead to obsolete load information.

This article introduces our concept of a novel network QoS device being located in network edge nodes. It provides a solution for relaxed QoS guarantees to certain flows on a congested link by focussing packet discard on selected flows.

Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of such systems with respect to the load balancing strategy required by the service application.

For technical reasons, SCTP uses one network path for data transmission and utilizes the other paths for backup only.

In this paper, we describe our approach of combining CMT with the idea of Resource Pooling~(RP) in order to achieve a performance improvement over non-CMT transfer while still remaining fair to concurrent flows on congested links. Unlike existing approaches which adapt classic TCP to a multi-homed CMT protocol, our approach does not depend on specific characteristics of TCP. Instead, we base on already entrenched functional blocks of CMT transfer, on the example of the CMT-enabled SCTP~(Stream Control Transmission Protocol).

In this paper, we propose our approach for breaking up the functionalities of the OSI Transport Layer into the concept so called functional building blocks. Each functional building block provides a particular service, which -- in interaction with the other functional building blocks -- is able to provide a service similar to the classic OSI Transport Layer. The concept allows for easy removal, replacement or addition of existing and new functional building blocks to adapt the service to state-of-the-art and future requirements, particularly including multi-path transport and QoS.}",

This is commonly known as Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT), approaches for several Transport Layer protocols have been proposed. Combined with Resource Pooling~(RP), CMT can also fairly coexist with concurrent non-CMT flows. Current approaches focus on symmetric paths (i.e.\ similar bandwidth, delay and error rate). However, asymmetric paths are much more likely -- particularly for realistic Internet setups -- and efficient CMT usage on such paths is therefore crucial.
In this paper, we first show the challenges of plain as well as RP-aware CMT data transport over asymmetric paths. After that, we introduce mechanisms for efficient transport over such paths. Finally, we analyse the performance of our approaches by using simulations.}",

But the Internet itself is not a good test environment, since its components are not controllable and certain problem situations (like congestion or error conditions) are difficult to reproduce. Various testbeds have been built up to fill this gap. Most of these testbeds also support link emulation, i.e.\ using software to mimic the characteristic behaviour of certain kinds of network links (like bandwidth bottlenecks or error-prone radio transmissions). The most popular link emulation systems are the Linux-based NetEm and Dummynet, which are e.g.\ applied on the IP~layer of Planet-Lab and various other testbeds. However, the restriction to the OSI Network Layer (here:~IP) is insufficient to test new non-IP Future Internet protocols.
In this paper, we first introduce Dummynet and NetEm. After that, we will present our approach of adapting Dummynet for Linux to support link emulation on the Data Link Layer. Finally, we evaluate the applicability and performance of Dummynet and NetEm for link emulation on the Data Link Layer, in a Planet-Lab-based testbed environment. Our goal is to outline the performance and limitations of both approaches in the context of Planet-Lab-based testbeds, in order to make them applicable for the evaluation of non-IP Future Internet protocols.}",

In order to support the IETF activities, we have set up a distributed Internet testbed for CMT evaluation. An important tool -- which we have developed for multi-protocol Transport Layer performance analysis -- is the Open Source

However, since TCP -- which constitutes the basis of most Internet applications -- and its congestion control procedures have been designed under the assumption of single-homed sites, fairness issues may arise by the usage of multipath transport. These issues are addressed by advanced congestion control approaches, which have already been examined by simulations. However, real-life network measurements are missing. In this paper, we perform an experimental proof-of-concept evaluation of several multipath congestion control strategies, which are currently under discussion within the IETF in the context of MPTCP as well as CMT-SCTP. Particularly, we validate effects that have been observed in simulations, in order to trigger further discussions on multipath congestion control. Also, our goal is to provide insight into the different approaches to support the ongoing IETF standardisation activities on multipath transport protocols.}",

	abstract = "{Today, a steadily growing number of devices contains multiple network interfaces. For example, nearly all smartphones are equipped with at least W-LAN as well as 3G/4G~interfaces. In consequence, there is a rising demand for so-called multi-path transfer, which utilizes all of these interfaces simultaneously in order to maximize the payload throughput of applications. Currently, this so-called multi-path transfer is very actively discussed by the IETF, in form of the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP as well as the Concurrent Multi-path Transfer extension for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP). Their larger-scale deployment in the Internet is expected for the near future.
A key issue that prevents the standardization of these approaches is the fairness to concurrent TCP flows. A multi-path transfer should behave "TCP-friendly", i.e.\ cause no harm to the performance of the very widely deployed TCP-based applications. In this paper, we first extend the notion of "fairness" from single-path transport to multi-path transport. Furthermore, we introduce the relevant congestion control approaches in the IETF context for single-path as well as multi-path transfer. We simulatively analyze these approaches in a couple of interesting network configuration scenarios, in order to show their behavior with special regard to the fairness definitions. Particularly, we also point out items of further discussion which are the result of the current approaches.}",

While it has originally been built for less critical services like e-mail and file transfer, it is nowadays also increasingly often used for availability-critical services like e.g.\ e-commerce or healthcare. Clearly, the reachability of such services must be ensured by so-called multi-homing of endpoints. That is, endpoints are simultaneously connected to multiple Internet Service Providers~(ISP) to provide redundancy. If one ISP has problems, it is intended that the connection to another one still works. However, such assumptions have never been verified in real, large-scale setups.
The intention of the NorNet project is to build up a realistic Internet testbed for multi-homing. In this paper, we describe the design of NorNet with focus on the implementation of its fixed-line part: NorNet Core. This paper is intended to give researchers an overview of its mode of operation, its capabilities as well as its interesting feature realisations. The knowledge about these items is very useful to plan own experiments in the NorNet testbed.}",

This so-called multi-homing also leads to the desire of utilising multiple network paths simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput. Clearly, this so-called multi-path transfer feature is also very useful for the transport of multimedia contents, particularly when a single network access alone is not fast enough to fulfil the bandwidth requirements of the application.
In many cases, multimedia transport is also sensitive for delays and packet losses. However, the focus of the current multi-path transfer approaches has been on bandwidth only. In order to tackle this challenge, our paper introduces two new send strategies to map payload data to different wireless paths. Finally, by using measurements, we show that a significant performance improvement for delay and loss-sensitive applications can be achieved in comparison to the existing approaches.}",

Nowadays, a large number of important services -- for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others -- depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds -- for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab -- have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing.
Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.}",

WLAN links have already been studied extensively in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on Mobile Broadband~(MBB) networks that are in use today. We utilized
NorNet Edge nodes that are connected to up to five different 3G ISPs (UMTS and CDMA2000), hence, providing a realistic view on the QoS characteristics that are experienced by end-users of these MBB networks. We present QoS characteristics (e.g.\ bandwidth, delay and loss) and discuss our observations. Our results shed light on what a multi-path transport endpoint has to expect -- and to efficiently cope with -- when using today's MBB networks as transport paths.}",

A transport protocol can make use of this best effort service to provide a suitable service to its applications. Also, its congestion control is responsible for a fair distribution of the resources within the Internet. However, background data transfer applications (like file sharing or update fetching) do not require "best effort", they in fact could use a "lower-than-best-effort" service to leave resources to more important applications if needed. For this purpose, the Low Extra Delay Background Transport~(LEDBAT) algorithm has been standardized by the IETF.
Nowadays, multi-homing is becoming increasingly common in modern networks and several approaches to exploit this feature (e.g.\ CMT-SCTP, MPTCP) have evolved that are able to combine resources of multiple paths. For background traffic oriented algorithms like LEDBAT, this feature could be of great use, too, i.e.\ by increasing the overall bandwidth while shifting the transmission away from paths which are used by other flows. This could be particularly useful for non-critical bulk transfers in data centres. In this paper, we introduce our approach LEDBAT for Multi-Path -- denoted as LEDBAT-MP -- and analyze its performance by simulations. With this paper, we want to highlight some generic design questions and start a discussion on how a solid universal background multi-path congestion control strategy should behave.}",

Besides the redundancy aspect, multi-homing can also make load sharing by multi-path transport possible, i.e.\ increasing the application throughput by utilising multiple paths simultaneously. Multi-path transport can e.g.\ be realised by Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP) and Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP), two protocols that are currently under standardisation in the IETF.
The growing need for and deployment of multi-homed applications makes large-scale testing and evaluation in realistic Internet setups necessary.

It provides programmable nodes with multiple ISP connections -- wired as well as wireless -- that are distributed all over Norway as well as some international locations.

In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors. We also present results from a 45~day field test with 13 observation points. These results confirm the advantages of a widely distributed monitoring setup and give some new insights into the behavior of the attackers.}",

Although the idea of using multiple interfaces simultaneously to improve application throughput is tempting, does transmission over multiple interfaces always provide benefits especially in realistic setup? In this paper, we first show that multi-path transfer might actually have a negative impact in real-world scenarios with mobile broadband and wireless LAN networks. We then introduce our Dynamic Relative Path Scoring (DRePaS) algorithm that continuously evaluates the contribution of paths to the overall performance and dynamically influences the scheduling decisions to make best use of the paths for the overall system performance. We show that DRePaS outperforms the current MPTCP implementation in terms of throughput and application delay, especially when the links are heterogeneous.}",

Not so many Internet service providers offer direct IPv6 connectivity to their customers, yet. Clearly, when IPv6 is available to customers, they expect that IPv6 offers at least the same -- or even better -- stability of connections in comparison to IPv4. The main goal of this paper is to investigate whether this is true today.
In our paper, we present up-to-date measurement results on the stability of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the real Internet, based on machines that are distributed over a large geographical area, as part of the NorNet Core testbed infrastructure for multi-homed systems. The measurements not only cover high-speed research networks, but also consumer-grade ADSL connections -- i.e. the ISP connection types of "normal" end-users -- as well as a broad range of different ISPs. The measurements show that IPv6 paths are less stable than corresponding IPv4 paths. We also find that the use of load balancing is more prevalent in IPv6 than in IPv4.}",

To avoid the Internet access becoming a single point of failure, redundancy by multi-homing -- i.e.\ simultaneous access to multiple Internet service providers~(ISP) -- is becoming increasingly common as well. Multi-homing leads to the desire to utilise all network attachment points simultaneously, which is e.g.\ provided by the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP. MPTCP is still under development by researchers and standardisation in the IETF. Particularly, it is necessary to evaluate MPTCP under realistic Internet conditions.
NorNet Core is the world's first, large-scale Internet testbed for multi-homed systems and applications. It is therefore a useful platform for evaluating MPTCP. In this paper, we therefore present our NorNet Core extension that adds MPTCP support to the testbed. Particularly, our extension is now available to all users of NorNet Core as well, which significantly reduces the effort of MPTCP researchers to evaluate MPTCP and its improvements. In a proof of concept, we furthermore show the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art MPTCP in NorNet Core, in a configuration covering 29~ISP connections at 14~sites in 5~different countries.}",

Clearly, a key feature of this testbed is to work in the real-world Internet. That is, it is especially desired to expose experiments to real Internet behaviour like background traffic. However, for the researcher, it is necessary to actually know how paths -- being used for an experiment -- actually behave: Are the paths actually working? How are the round-trip times among sites over different ISPs, etc.. How did the behaviour change over time?
To provide such information to the researchers, we have designed and developed a maintenance and monitoring infrastructure for the NorNet Core testbed. In this paper, we will first introduce this infrastructure. Furthermore, we will demonstrate its usefulness with some useful, real-world examples.

Furthermore, the growing popularity of multi-path transport, especially Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) that is the extension of the well-known Transmission Control Protocol~(TCP), leads to the question of whether this identity duality can be utilized for improving application performance in addition to providing resilience. In this paper, we first investigate the AS-level congruency of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the Internet. We find that more than 60\% of the current IPv4 and IPv6 AS-paths are non-congruent at the AS-level, which motivates us to explore how MPTCP can utilize the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality to improve data transfer performance. Our results show that MPTCP, even with a single dual-stack Internet connection, can significantly improve the end-to-end performance when the underlying paths are non-congruent. The extent of the improvement can reach up to the aggregate of the IPv4 and IPv6 bandwidth.}",

However, there is nowadays also a growing demand for transmitting big amounts of data in the background, namely background transport that uses spare capacity, but with minimal effect on other traffic. For instance, systems can proactively download content that the user/system would need in the future (e.g.\ update packages, video files, etc.). Efforts have therefore been made in the IETF for the sake of such a service with Low Extra Delay Background Traffic~(LEDBAT) congestion control. While LEDBAT works in some cases, there are however known situations where it causes serious performance problems, particularly in combination with the ubiquitous bufferbloat for example in current broadband networks.
	In this paper, we analyse the issues of LEDBAT and propose a new approach for background traffic. Inspired by an astronomical event, we have named this approach Eclipse. Unlike LEDBAT, Eclipse can dynamically adapt to the network characteristics not only to minimise the additional network delay but also to maximise the utilisation of spare network capacity. We will show the usefulness of Eclipse by simulations.}",

With the increasing deployment of multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and the Concurrent Multipath Transfer extension of SCTP (CMT-SCTP), the term "fair" can have various interpretations. In this paper, inconsistencies are avoided by classifying fairness definitions according to the resource -bottleneck or network - and the participants - subflow, flow, tariff, etc. that share the resource. With example network scenarios the current (TCP-compatible) fairness view from both the single and multipath perspective is presented and their short-comings discussed. Alternative definitions are introduced and their benefits are illustrated based on a theoretical analysis. The realization aspects of the discussed fairness definitions are also presented. The evaluations of available coupled congestion control variants for multipath transport are shown to highlight the proximity of the simulated results to the theoretical target values. Due to the complexity of the realization of network-based approaches, bottleneck is chosen as the preferred resource. Tariff is a promising participant as it couples applications and incorporates economic entities for fair resource sharing at the transport layer.}",

fairness definitions. For a rigorous analysis, existing fairness definitions are identified according to the resources (bottleneck or network) and the competing participants (flow, tariff or user). Tariff as the participant, provides a realistic option to comply with the service level agreement between the operator and the user where as flow as the participant leads to TCP-compatible allocation. From the obtained results, it can be seen that if fairness is applied at the bottleneck then it is absolutely fair to the individual participants w.r.t. the bottleneck. On the other hand, fairness mechanisms considering the whole network as a single resource exploit the freedom of resource allocation (due to multipath flows) to achieve an overall similar allocation for the different participants (irrespective if the participant is composed of singlepath or multipath flows) but are still restricted by the topological constraints and might even result in a lower overall network throughput.}",

Its coupled congestion control intends to reap the increased bandwidth of multiple links, while avoiding to be more aggressive than regular TCP flows on every used link. We argue that this leads to a very conservative behavior when paths do not share a bottleneck. Therefore, in this paper, we first quantify the penalty of the coupled congestion control for the links that do not share a bottleneck. Then, in order to overcome this penalty, we design and implement a practical shared bottleneck detection (SBD) algorithm for MPTCP, namely MPTCP-SBD. Through extensive emulations, we show that MPTCP-SBD outperforms all currently deployed MPTCP coupled congestion controls by accurately detecting bottlenecks resulting in throughput gains of up to 30\% in the absence of shared bottlenecks while remaining fair to TCP in shared bottlenecks scenarios. We complement the emulation results with real-network experiments justifying it is safeness for deployment.}",

We consider Concurrent Multi-path Transfer for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP) and Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) and evaluate their proficiency in transporting video, gaming, and web traffic over combinations of WLAN and 3G interfaces. To ensure the validity of our evaluation, several experimental approaches were used including simulation, emulation and live experiments. When paths are symmetric in terms of capacity, delay and loss rate, we find that the experienced latency is significantly reduced, compared to using a single path. Using multiple asymmetric paths does not affect latency -- applications do not experience any increase or decrease, but might benefit from other advantages of multi-path communication. In the light of our conclusions, multi-path transport is suitable for latency-sensitive traffic and mature enough to be widely deployed.}",

	abstract = "{A large fraction of the communication in the Internet is handled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Since the first deployments of this protocol more than 30 years ago, the spectrum of applications as well as the structure of the network have developed at a fast pace. For example, today's network devices, like smartphones and laptops -- i.e.\ particularly many devices in the area of mobile computing -- frequently have an interesting property: the existence of multiple IP addresses (IPv4 and/or IPv6). The addresses may even change due to mobility. This property, denoted as multi-homing, can be utilised for multi-path transport, i.e. the simultaneous usage of multiple paths in the network to improve performance. Multi-path transport is a hot topic in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is the standardisation organisation for the Internet.
This talk provides an overview of the work in the areas of multi-homing and multi-path transport, with focus on the area of the protocols TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with their experimental extensions Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) and Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP (CMT-SCTP). It particularly shows the sequence of research and selected results, beginning from a simple simulation model, via lab setups and small Internet scenarios, up to the large-scale, international testbed project NorNet. NorNet, and particularly its landline network part NorNet Core, is furthermore described in some detail. Based on NorNet, it is finally possible to validate simulation results in real-world, multi-homed networks, in order to provide valuable input to the ongoing IETF standardisation processes of MPTCP and CMT-SCTP.}",

This multi-homing property can be used for resilience, but there is also an increasing interest in making use of concurrent multi-path transport. That is, multiple network paths can be utilised simultaneously, in order to improve the payload throughput for applications like big data or cloud computing.
In this paper, we examine the performance of multi-path transport in real-world Internet setups, based on Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) in the NorNet testbed for multi-homed systems. However, systems in such challenging setups need proper configuration. Therefore, we particularly would like to highlight the performance impact of different path management and congestion control settings in such realistic scenarios.}",

Of course, having multiple and possibly highly dissimilar paths for transmission is a challenge for the management of the send and receive buffers, since optimal throughput is desired with a reasonable allocation of the limited memory resources in MPTCP endpoints. This is particularly important when many MPTCP connections have to be handled simultaneously.
This paper measures out the required MPTCP buffer size in the real-world Internet testbed NorNet, comparing theoretical size and real size to analyse MPTCP performance. The experiment shows that multi-path transmission can effectively increase the application payload throughput, and greatly improve the robustness of the data transmission. As an important point of this paper, we can show that appropriate buffer size settings can increase the payload throughput, while not wasting resources.
This paper has certain significance for further accurately determining the optimal buffer size settings for multi-path transmission in large-scale Internet setups.}",

However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of such an application.
As a first step towards understanding whether "WebRTC QoS works", we measured, for both IPv4 and IPv6, what happens to DSCP values along Internet paths. Our study is based on end-to-end measurements from 160 IPv4 and 65 IPv6 geographically spread controlled probe clients to 34 IPv4 and 18 IPv6 servers respectively. Clearly, when the DSCP value is changed, the net result may not be what the application desired. We find that this happens often, and conclude with recommendations on how to improve WebRTC and other applications using the DSCP.}",

Finally, a video broadcast platform is set up based upon the technologies of IPv6+MPTCP. It verifies the effectiveness and usability combining these two technologies.

With the increasing need for mobility and micro-services, particularly with the upcoming 5G mobile broadband networks, there is also a strong demand for mobile edge computing (MEC): applications run in small cloud systems in close proximity to the user, in order to minimize latencies. Both cloud and MEC have their advantages and disadvantages. Combining the two approaches in a unified multi-cloud, consisting of both traditional cloud services provisioned over heterogeneous cloud platforms and MEC systems, has the potential of obtaining the best out of both worlds. However, a comprehensive study is needed to evaluate the performance gains and the overheads involved for real-world cloud applications. In this paper, we introduce a baseline performance evaluation in order to identify the fallacies and pitfalls of combining multiple cloud systems and MEC into a unified MEC-multi-cloud platform. For this purpose, we analyze the basic, application-independent performance metrics of average round-trip time (RTT) and average application payload throughput in a setup consisting of two private and one public cloud systems. This baseline performance analysis confirms the feasibility of MEC-multi-cloud, and provides guidelines for designing an autonomic resource provisioning solutions, in terms of an extension proposed to our existing Melodic middleware platform for multi-cloud applications.}",

However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of such an application. We present measurements, for both IPv4 and IPv6, of what happens to DSCP values along Internet paths after an end system has set them without any prior agreement between a customer and a service provider. We find that the DSCP is often changed or zeroed along the path, but detrimental effects from using the DSCP are extremely rare; moreover, DSCP values sometimes remain intact (potentially having an effect on traffic) for several AS hops. This positive result motivates an analysis of the potential latency impact from such DSCP usage, for which we present the first measurement results. We find that routers at approximately 3% of more than 100,000 links differentiate between the WebRTC DSCP values (EF, AF42 and CS1) and consistently reduce delay in comparison with probes carrying a zero value (CS0) under congestion. In contrast, routers at around 2% of these links increase the delay by a comparable amount under congestion, uniformly for EF, AF42 and CS1.}",

The IETF Transport Services (TAPS) Working Group is standardizing a protocol-independent transport API and offering guidance to implementers. Apple’s recent “Network.framework” is specifically designed to allow such late and dynamic binding of protocols. When the network stack autonomously chooses and configures a protocol, it must first test which protocols are locally available and which work end-to-end (“protocol racing”). For this, it is important to know the set of available options, and which protocols should be tried first: Does it make sense to offer unchecked payload delivery, as with UDP-Lite? Is a UDP-based protocol like QUIC always a better choice, or should native SCTP be tried? This paper develops answers to such questions via (i) a NAT study in a local testbed, (ii) bidirectional Internet tests, (iii) a large scale Internet measurement campaign. The examined protocols are: SCTP, DCCP, UDP-Lite, UDP with a zero checksum and three different UDP encapsulations.}",

In this paper, we propose network coded torrents~(NECTOR) to leverage multiple network interfaces for resilient hybrid satellite communications~(SatCom) and terrestrial networking for UAVs. NECTOR is significantly different from the state-of-the-art multipath protocols such as multipath TCP~(MPTCP) as it does not require any additional packet scheduler, rate-adaptation or forward error correction. We present the design and implementation of NECTOR, and evaluate its performance compared to MPTCP. Our experimental results show that NECTOR provides goodput (up to 70\%) higher than MPTCP with 5.49~times less signaling overhead.}",

Considering that service assurance~(SA) is a major area to which AI is applied, this paper describes how a closed-loop SA architecture is associated with the service exposure model in the 5G networks with network slicing.

A small percentage of IP geolocation disagreement between databases results in a significant disagreement when geolocating end-to-end paths.

However, while there is a lot of research on the Transport Layer aspects of multi-path transport, there is not much work on the Network Layer perspective, yet.
In this paper, we introduce our Open Source tool HiPerConTracer (High-Performance Connectivity Tracer) for efficient, parallelised, long-term measurements of the path connectivity characteristics among multi-homed Internet systems. HiPerConTracer is now running as a permanent feature in the NorNet Core infrastructure, which is used for research on multi-homed systems, and in particular for research on multi-path transport. Based on the HiPerConTracer data collected in NorNet Core so far, we finally present some interesting results from the analysis of the inter-continental site connectivity between China and Norway in January 2020.

	abstract = "{A large fraction of the communication in the Internet is handled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Since the first deployments of this protocol more than 30 years ago, the spectrum of applications as well as the structure of the network have developed at a fast pace. For example, today's network devices, like smartphones and laptops -- i.e.\ particularly many devices in the area of mobile computing -- frequently have an interesting property: the existence of multiple IP addresses (IPv4 and/or IPv6). The addresses may even change due to mobility. This property, denoted as multi-homing, can be utilised for multi-path transport, i.e. the simultaneous usage of multiple paths in the network to improve performance. Multi-path transport is a hot topic in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is the standardisation organisation for the Internet.
This talk provides an overview of the work in the areas of multi-homing and multi-path transport, with focus on the area of the protocols TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with their experimental extensions Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) and Concurrent Multi-Path Transfer for SCTP (CMT-SCTP). It particularly shows the sequence of research and selected results, beginning from a simple simulation model, via lab setups and small Internet scenarios, up to the large-scale, international testbed project NorNet. NorNet, and particularly its landline network part NorNet Core, is furthermore described in some detail. Based on NorNet, it is finally possible to validate simulation results in real-world, multi-homed networks, in order to provide valuable input to the ongoing IETF standardisation processes of MPTCP and CMT-SCTP. Particularly, it will also show how the NorNet testbed can be utilised for research at Hainan University in 2021.}",

We investigate the performance of the Internet control plane and data plane from a number of globally spread vantage points. We also look closer at two case studies. First, we look at growth in video traffic during the pandemic, using traffic logs from a global video conferencing provider. Second, we leverage a country-wide deployment of measurement probes to assess the performance of mobile networks during the outbreak. We find that the lockdown has visibly impacted almost all aspects of Internet performance. Access networks have experienced an increase in peak and off-peak end to end latency. Mobile networks exhibit significant changes in download speed, while certain types of video traffic has increased by an order of magnitude.}",

However, the complexity lies in how to simply and efficiently realise MEC services, with the auxiliary public (multi-)cloud resources?
In this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept for using Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) as a light-weight layer of managing resource pools and handling application sessions with these pools. Our approach is simple, efficient, has low overhead and is available as open source. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by measuring in a test setup, with a 4G testbed connected to MEC and public multi-cloud resources.}",

In this paper, we propose an exposed CL model based on service exposure and apply it to automate service assurance tasks like autoscaling in a network function virtualization (NFV) system orchestrated by ETSI Open Source MANO (OSM). A testbed is built to validate the model. It collects monitoring data from the OSM monitoring module and external monitoring tools. Vertical customers drive and customize their AI solutions to aggregate these data sets and run analytics to detect and predict anomalies prepared for scaling.

Studies have shown that path management and packet scheduling have a large effect on overall performance and required limited resources with different congestion control parameters. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the improvement of a single parameter, without a holistic view. To deal with this issue effectively, this paper puts forward a Multi-Parameter Comprehensive Optimized Algorithm (MPCOA), which can find the smaller buffer size and select the appropriate congestion control and path management algorithm on the premise of ensuring larger throughput. Experiments of three scenarios show that MPCOA can save the buffer space and subflow resources, and achieve high throughput. Meanwhile, a set of quantitative improvement results given by MPCOA is convenient for us to evaluate the quality of MPTCP network, and provide reference for our ongoing future work, like for 4G/5G, Internet of Things and Star Link networks.}",

The particular property of multi-homed systems is to be connected to multiple Internet Service Providers (ISP) simultaneously. Its initial purpose is of course to still provide connectivity in case of ISP/network failures. But does it really work that well, also with current protocols and applications? And redundancy does not come for free. A user connected to multiple ISPs will also receive multiple Internet bills each month. So, is there a possibility to make further use of multi-homing in the usual case where nothing goes wrong? Obviously, there are a lot of interesting research questions, which need to be examined in realistic Internet setups! Therefore, we are building up the NorNet open Internet testbed platform as a Linux- and Open-Source-software-based infrastructure, which currently spreads over multiple sites in different countries.
NorNet makes extensive use of advanced Linux features like Kernel-based Virtualisation (KVM), Linux Containers (LXC), BTRFS file system features, IP routing rules, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP), and many more. The goal of this talk is therefore to present an overview of the testbed, its underlying Linux features, and how they are combined to provide the multi-homing features to the various testbed users. This particularly includes an overview of how to make use of multi-path transport with MPTCP – based on the Linux MPTCP implementation – in multi-homed environments.

Mobile (computing) devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous to our computing domain, but with limited resources (true both for computation as well as for energy). Hence, workload offloading from resource-constrained mobile devices to the edge and maybe later to the cloud become necessary as well as useful. Thanks to the persistent technical breakthroughs in global wireless standards (or in mobile networks), together with the almost limitless amount of resources in public cloud platforms, workload offloading is possible and cheaper. In such scenarios, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) resources could be provisioned in proximity to the users for supporting latency-sensitive applications. Here, two relevant problems could be:
i) How to distribute workload to the resource pools of MEC as well as public (multi-)clouds?
ii) How to manage such resource pools effectively?
To answer these problems in this paper, we examine the performance of our proposed approach using the Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) framework in more detail. We also have outlined the resource pool management policies to effectively use RSerPool for workload offloading from mobile devices into the cloud/MEC ecosystem.

With the intuition that every device on the data path contributes to the end-to-end delay, we propose a simple and deterministic measurement-based approach for detecting the insertion of a layer-2 switch on the data path of a network operator. For this purpose, we use commodity hardware and the standard ping tool for collecting ICMP RTTs. To minimise inaccuracies in the measurements, we increase timing determinism on both ICMP source and target by using a real-time kernel on both, a dedicated source (a Linux server) and target (an RPI4 with custom image). Additionally, we manipulate real-time attributes for prioritising the ping process. By using this approach on different loaded networks: lab, campus network, research and education network and an ISP, we are able to reliably detect that a switch was added at the end of the path or within it. Our method yields an excellent performance on networks with considerable cross traffic as well as lightly loaded networks.}",

However, the high growth in size and complexity of current operational networks (2022) demands new solutions to process huge amounts of data (including alarms) reliably and swiftly. Further, as the network becomes progressively more virtualized, the hosting of nfv on cloud environments adds a magnitude of possible bottlenecks outside the control of the service owners. In this paper, we propose two deep learning anomaly detection solutions that leverage service exposure and apply it to automate the detection of service degradation and root cause discovery in a cloudified mobile network that is orchestrated by ETSI OSM. A testbed is built to validate these AI models. The testbed collects monitoring data from the OSM monitoring module, which is then exposed to the external AI anomaly detection modules, tuned to identify the anomalies and the network services causing them. The deep learning solutions are tested using various artificially induced bottlenecks. The AI solutions are shown to correctly detect anomalies and identify the network components involved in the bottlenecks, with certain limitations in a particular type of bottlenecks. A discussion of the right monitoring tools to identify concrete bottlenecks is provided.}",

Existing technologies of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) make content distribution and access easy while primarily relying on the existing cloud-based security features. The primary aim of ICN is to make data independent of its storage location and application. ICN builds upon traditional distributed computing, which means ICN platforms also can suffer from similar data security issues as distributed computing platforms. We present our ongoing work to develop a secure, proactive data distribution framework. The framework answers the research question, i.e., How to extend online data protection with a secure data distribution model for the ICN platform? Our framework adds a data protection layer over the content distribution network, using blockchain and relying on the fog to distribute the contents with low latency. Our framework is different from the existing works in multiple aspects, such as i) data are primarily distributed from the fog nodes, ii) blockchain is used to protect data and iii) blockchain allows statistical and other information sharing among stakeholders (such as content creators) following access rights. Sharing statistics about content distribution activity can bring transparency and trustworthiness among the stakeholders, including the subscribers, into the ICN platforms. We showed such a framework is possible by presenting initial performance results and our reflections while implementing it on a cloud/fog research testbed.}",

Thanks to the advancement in the network infrastructure, task offloading from resource-constrained devices to the near edge and the cloud becomes possible and advantageous.

Generally, the edge computing resources support latency-sensitive applications with limited computing resources, while the cloud supports latency-tolerant applications. This paper proposes one lightweight task-scheduling framework from cloud service provider perspective, for applications using both cloud and edge platforms. Here, the challenge is using edge and cloud resources efficiently when necessary. Such decisions have to be made quickly, with a small management overhead. Our framework aims at solving two research questions. They are: i) How to distribute tasks to the edge resource pools and multi-clouds? ii) How to manage these resource pools effectively with low overheads? To answer these two questions, we examine the performance of our proposed framework based on Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool). We have shown via simulations that RSerPool, with the correct usage and configuration of pool member selection policies, can accomplish the cloud/edge setup resource selection task with a small overhead.}",

This calls for increased monitoring of the fibre network, which is a highly critical part of the infrastructure. State of Polarisation (SoP) of light propagating through fibre transmission systems is impacted by any vibrations and mechanical impacts on the fibre. By continuously monitoring the SoP, any unexpected movements of a fibre along a fibre-path may be traced. Movements may be caused by e.g. work in node-rooms impacting patch-cords, trawlers or other types of sub-sea equipment touching or hooking into sub-sea fibre cables, digging close to a fibre-cable, or geophysical phenomena like earthquakes. In this paper, we describe a low-cost, scalable system for SoP monitoring and give examples of patterns monitored in different types of fibre infrastructures. The monitoring system consists of single-unit rack-mount instruments connected to taps from live optical transmission signals. Each instrument has local storage for 1-2 years of data, and is periodically automatically uploading data to a server for backup and data-access purposes. Examples of observed patterns are impact from a thunderstorm on a Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH) cable, 50 Hz on a fibre-cable spun around a high-voltage power air-cable, as well as animal impact on a patch-cord.}",

Following the cloud business model, one is either a cloud-based service provider or a cloud service (hardware and software) user. There is a continuous evolution in the cloud ecosystem to support the ever-changing features of user applications. The cloud ecosystem has added a new resource delegation model to accommodate such new requirements. This new resource delegation model is known as fog. Both cloud and fog platforms employ complex hardware and software to provide better run-time support for applications. This paper presents a message-based privacy-aware application execution zone management framework for the cloud/fog platform. The framework aims to create a static execution zone based on the performance of the user application and the data privacy requirements. It also enables the user to set the resource termination conditions. Here, we have prototyped the proposed framework and showed how the proposed approach works with message structure and experiments with the P4 switch. We also present how the prototype could be implemented on a cloud/fog platform.}",

Unix systems, particularly Linux and FreeBSD, provide some features to obtain network packet timing information, but there is a lack of documentation for these. With High-Performance Connectivity Tracer (HiPerConTracer), there is already an open source tool for running large-scale, long-running and high-frequency ICMP Ping and Traceroute measurements. However, it lacks support of high-precision timing.
As part of this paper, first the network packet timestamping features of Unix systems are analysed and introduced, to provide the reader with a detailed overview over the available methods, their usage, as well as their limitations. Then, enhancements to HiPerConTracer are presented for adding high-precision timestamping support, as well as a UDP module to also perform UDP Ping and Traceroute measurements. Finally, the newly added features are demonstrated in a proof-of-concept analysis.}",

	abstract = "{Cloudified mobile networks are expected to deliver a multitude of services with reduced capital and operating expenses. A characteristic example is 5G networks serving several slices in parallel. Such mobile networks, therefore, need to ensure that the SLAs of customised end-to-end sliced services are met. This requires monitoring the resource usage and characteristics of data flows at the virtualised network core, as well as tracking the performance of the radio interfaces and UEs. A centralised monitoring architecture can not scale to support millions of UEs though. This paper, proposes a 2-stage distributed telemetry framework in which UEs act as early warning sensors. After UEs flag an anomaly, a ML model is activated, at network controller, to attribute the cause of the anomaly. The framework achieves 85% F1-score in detecting anomalies caused by different bottlenecks, and an overall 89% F1-score in attributing these bottlenecks. This accuracy of our distributed framework is similar to that of a centralised monitoring system, but with no overhead of transmitting UE-based telemetry data to the centralised controller. The study also finds that passive in-band network telemetry has the potential to replace active monitoring and can further reduce the overhead of a network monitoring system.}",
